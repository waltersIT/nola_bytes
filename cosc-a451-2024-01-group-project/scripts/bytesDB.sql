INSERT INTO yelp.review VALUES (3996, 'I heard about Luca''s while rehabbing my broken shoulder and I have been dying to try it. Right now the city is making it difficult to get there by digging up most of the neighborhood but I urge you to persevere. Trust me - it''s worth it!  I had a steak sandwich that nothing short of spectacular!  The steak, the house made horseradish sauce and the grilled onions were perfection. The bread was crisp without being tough as ciabatta can sometimes be. I was full halfway through but I couldn''t stop until I had eaten the whole thing. If I could change anything it would be to have Coke Zero as a soft drink option. I can''t wait to go back!', 1, 5, 1);
INSERT INTO yelp.review VALUES (3997, 'If I ever move out of New Orleans, Luca Eats will be at the top of my list for places to visit during my stay here. Not only is this establishment wonderfully located in the Uptown Area, they have plenty of outside and inside seating for you to enjoy the area. The owners are always there and *always* so sweet to the guests. I have had the chocolate chip banana bread probably ~5 times now, and when I tell you... I like to think I make a good banana bread, but Luca Eats wins this category. Their coffee is also a favorite, with them offering a large variety of flavors. I''ve had the chorizo and egg breakfast sandwich, and it was quite the delight! It is slightly messy (for me, anyway), so be careful because I dropped some on my new shoes (good times). Their crawfish ettouffee will leave your mouth salivating- it''s so full of flavor and screams New Orleans cuisine. Lastly, my friends rave about the Spinach & Artichoke croissant. 
I would highly recommend Luca Eats for a quick eat while you''re in the area or even if you''re searching for places to take visiting friends!', 2, 5, 1);

I ordered a bowl of gumbo it was mostly juice, there was one piece of sausage and less than a spoon of rice not much flavor.

Too pricey.', 4, 3, 1);
INSERT INTO yelp.review VALUES (4000, 'I found this place thanks to a construction detour that brought me through blocks I wasn''t familiar with. 

I was intrigued when I passed this little gem and promised myself I''d swing by at lunchtime to give it a try.

I placed an order by phone for a steak sandwich for myself and a Cubano for my honey. Both were EXCELLENT!  Everything about these pressed sandwiches was perfect!  I will definitely be back, and soon. They serve tons of different coffees, and there was one made with Nutella that I''m planning to try next week.

My only negative feedback is that the space is small and indoor seating is very limited. This seems fine on a nice day because there is some seating outside, but if the weather isn''t cooperating you''ll want to take your order to go.I won''t remove a star from my rating, because quite honestly, I found this space charming.

In conclusion, I loved my sandwich and the service was excellent.', 5, 5, 1);
INSERT INTO yelp.review VALUES (4001, 'Luca Eats is a New Orleans coffee shop and café located in New Orleans near Tulane University and across from St. Mary''s Cemetery at 7329 Cohn Street which is about 18 minutes and 5 miles away from the New Orleans French Quarter. This looks like a very cool place from the exterior and most of the seating is outside while the inside is a very small space with limited seating. Luca Eats was established back in 2016 and has become noted for their breakfast and lunch options where they serve locally roasted premium coffee and homemade hand-pressed sandwiches. It is on the more expensive side and I don''t really find their sandwiches very filling.  Overall I would personally prefer a poboy somewhere else.

INSERT INTO yelp.review VALUES (4005, 'The Good: This place has the look and feel of your standard Southern Diner (if there is such a thing as "standard" in Southern diners) that you can find all over most of the South. I tried the pimento cheese burger with fries and the burger tasted exactly like one you would grill yourself on an outdoor grill. The best things about the burger were that it used a good bun and I got it dressed and the veggies were extremely fresh. The fries were very good and perfectly done with a nice crisp outside. They had some interesting blackboard specials and drinks listed. They also have a very large bar that you can sit and eat at and that is one of my favorite spots to sit when dining solo.  Since my first visit years ago I have made several follow up visits and they really have gotten their seafood specials down to an excellent level.  They have plenty of other specials but I find the seafood ones to be really top notch.  The burgers here have also gotten much better over time as well. 

The Bad from when they first opened: The menu was pretty small when they first started and they had a really limited selection of sides. I love meat and veggie plates but I don''t like fatback or bacon in my veggies and half or more of the few veggies on the menu seemed to have that in them. Another bad aspect with the side veggies is you only get a choice of one with your meal and almost every other place across the South I''ve eaten in places like this you always have a choice of at least 2 or more veggies. I observed other people''s food and other than the sandwiches and burgers they didn''t look all that great--just ok. The service was also a tad bit slow on getting refills on my drink.  More recently: The food has improved substantially form when they first opened however they still don''t do a traditional meat and three Southern Style meal here although they easily could but instead you are getting a meat and one or maybe a meat and two.  

The Ugly from back when they opened years ago: The price for my burger and iced tea came to $14.82 (before tip which these days that would be a great value) so that was (back in those better days) a mighty expensive lunch for just a burger! I could have gone to Yo Mama''s (sadly long closed now) or La Petite Grocery and gotten better food at that price. There is also considerable sticker shock (which seems to have become the norm for new places opening recently) with the price of beer on the menu set at $6 and that price for an Abita Amber is outrageous for Freret Street and all of Uptown (and this was years ago when they first opened).  

Now as inflation has gone insane along with the rest of the world the prices here haven''t gone up as much as many other places so what seemed to be crazy prices when this joint first opened now seem way more reasonable.  Overall they do have some great food here and what used to be high prices has become the new normal so this joint isn''t as overpriced as it used to be when it first opened.

We were a group of 9 but I noticed the smaller sized tables were having similar service as us. This ended up being a 3 hour experience in what felt like an 80° sauna where everyone in the restaurant was shout-talking. It was a lot. 

We were sat 45min after our reservation (we received a text earlier to come 15min later) and it took another 45min to get our first round of drinks. Our water glasses were empty most of the night, wine pairings were often forgotten, those who didn''t do the wine pairing weren''t asked if they wanted another drink, one main course wasn''t made, and food was served without silverware. The courses were so spread apart we were ready to go halfway through the 3 course meal.

The restaurant is in what might have been a home in the past.  Very unassuming but once you''re there, you will immediately know what the fuss is all about.  I wanted a place a little farther from the busy scene so I chose Boucherie for that reason.  

We arrived, informed the host of our reservations and we were seated immediately on a corner table.  The place was fairly quiet, had a full bar, and attentive wait staff.  

Our dining experience began with some smoked tuna ragoons with Louisiana strawberry dipping sauce.  The smoked tuna was a little bit on the salty side but otherwise, the flavors between the sauce and the ragoons worked.

For my main dish, I ordered the scallops which were divine!  Very flavorful, prepared perfectly and the sauce was magnificent.  I could have probably polished off another serving of it (on a different night, of course!). My meal was lovely and exquisite.

Our ride dropped us off and I thought we were lost. The restaurant is very unassuming from the front. The name of the restaurant is painted on a board along the side of the stairway. Otherwise, it looks like any other house. We got there a little early, so we walked around a bit, then made our way over. They opened at 5pm and our resv was for 5:15. Great time to get there!

We ordered a bottle of wine and prepared for the food to begin. I''m not going to go into every course. I will just say that the food was absolutely phenomenal!!! The meal was Asian themed and seafood prominent. Chef Nathaniel Zimet and the staff did an incredible job with the planning and preparation of the meal. If the regular menu is half as good as this was, you''re in for a treat. Our top two courses were the Wagyu tartare and the lobster miso soup. We were having difficulty narrowing it down to two!
As for the service... Benjamin was perfect! Funny, knowledgeable, and so quick to get us what we needed. The meal itself took a long time, by American standards... 3 1/2 hours from sit down to finish. Time flew! That is NOT typical timing for here, so don''t think you will be here forever. Tonight was a special menu and special circumstances. I just hope that if anyone else posts about tonight, they keep that in mind.

Duck Confit. I''ve eaten alot of confit in my life and career (former Chef) and this was by far the crispiest and most tender! 

Mussels. So good we had it TWICE in one sitting! Great portion for the price!! 

Ceviche. Husband was being adventurous he said it was good but he was unsure about the "stuff" was fennel  but he liked it. 

Shrimp and Grit Cake. Had hubby ranting and raving!! Shrimp were large, plump and perfectly cooked! 

Collards. Highly recommend dumping them in to the mussel broth it''s tangy and has some bacon fattiness in there for a perfect savory flavor. 

Grilled Romaine Cesar. Was hesitant because it''s grilled but WOW. My taste buds danced! 

Crab Beignet. More like a hush puppy but you could def taste a little sweetness and yummy crab flavor!!

Cocktails/Mocktails: Def not on the sweet side at all. So if you like a balanced sweet/tangy def let them know more on the sweet side.

Krispy Kreme Bread Pudding: Hubby Loved It but I could have gone for a bit of a glaze on top!

INSERT INTO yelp.review VALUES (4040, 'Pigeon and Whale is an interesting new restaurant located in the Freret Street development area that opened up back in July of 2023.  They certainly do things quite differently here than other restaurants in the New Orleans area as, while they focus on seafood, they absolutely don''t do anything New Orleans or Southern style here as this is a New England style seafood joint.  Pigeon and Whale also puts a lot of effort into their raw bar and caviar service offering some options not commonly found in Louisiana. They also really focus on their cocktails here to the point that I couldn''t get an iced tea here and they only have canned drinks for anything non-alcoholic. 

Having something a bit different can be interesting and they certainly do some things quite quirky and unique compared to other spots in the area here.  They do offer that New England fan favorite of the lobster roll here, which I''ve eaten many examples of all over when visiting New England, and I have always found them to be OK sandwiches but always too tiny compared to a poboy for my appetite.  So I decided to roll the dice and order the lobster roll here to sample it and unlike most of my experiences in New England they actually serve the version here with a side of what they call "Jo-Jo Potatoes" and what I would call potato logs (which are nice big slices of potatoes deep fried) which actually make this lobster roll a decent meal for me.  I found the lobster roll here to be one of the best versions I''ve experienced so far and on average better than most I''ve had in New England.  

They also have some extremely creative and interesting desserts here and I decided the sample the "Bathtub Dreams" which is chocolate mousse with hazelnut ganache and whipped cream all over it served in a bathtub shaped dish so that it looks like a "bubble bath" and then they place a shortbread "whale tail" coming out of the "bubbles" along with a candy "rubber duck" on top.  This dessert was visually interesting and tasted ok but I probably wouldn''t get it again as it was just way too much whipped cream and it might have been far better with a layer of ice cream instead of so such much whipped cream.

Overall if you''re in the mood for something completely different than New Orleans food this spot will give you that experience.

We decided on the 4 course family-style tasting because we really wanted the paella and the 3 courses didn''t include it  lol. The website was a bit deceiving in that it looked like we get to choose the 4 courses, but it was the chef''s choice. 

Service 9/10: Our waiter did an amazing job explaining all our questions about the dishes we were interested. We love when a waiter knows the menu in and out, rather than just saying everything is good lol. The only nit-picky thing I have to say is it took a little minute to refill my water. Really not a big deal, but I did notice they had a ton of staff working. 

Course 1:
Boquerones were delicious. The anchovies on top of the crispy sourdough with sauce were an excellent combination of textures! Pretty yummy. I don''t care for olives so didn''t pick at that much, but they were alright. The bombas were crispy bites of deliciousness. And lastly, my favorite, the American Red Snapper Crudo was so goooooooood. I am a fan of raw fish so it may not be for everyone, but for those that enjoy the taste of the ocean, you won''t be disappointed. Super refreshing and paired nicely with the citrus, pistachio, and chili for added texture. 

Course 2: The Mixed Mushrooms were a mix of various types of mushrooms topped with crispy bits and egg yolk in the center for aesthetics and richness. Super flavorful and juicy. I''m not a salad type, but I will say I enjoyed the grilled salad. Just a nice, flavorful, refreshing grilled salad. Loved the pickled vegetables and salad dressing. 

Course 3: The seafood paella!!!! If you get anything here, I recommend this. Truly a paella like I''ve never had. With an abundant assortment of different seafood including shrimp, mussels, clams, and octopus I loved every single bite of it. I think I''m missing a few other ingredients in the dish, but the rice was cooked and seasoned to perfection. All the different bits of vegetables added layers of textures and paired nicely with everything. 

Course 4: The chocolate mousse was good. I thought mousse was a bit more airy but I''m not too familiar so.', 55, 4, 7);

Paired with the delicious mushroom hummus - it''s a match made in heaven. First time eating lutenitsa (a spread with tomatoes, peppers and eggplant) and it was such a delight. The matzo ball soup was good too but beware that it only comes as a single serving. Last but not the least, the lamb kofta was flavorful and juicy!

I was leaving my job (yes actually onsite!) and realized I was starving an in no mood to prepare my own food. And I remembered I had seen a yummy sandwich on the Iacovone website. So I called it up on my phone and somehow ended up in Postmates (although they do Waitr) as well. 

Ordered my items (and sides) and then drove over to their storefront. And it is just a storefront. This is a takeaway spot so they are setup to give you the goods. My food was ready and delicious. For some reason PM wouldn''t let me tip on pickup (and that''s not cool so I probably won''t use them again... of course it could have been operator error). So I put some cash on the table.

I had the shrimp boil panini and the next day I ate my winter caprese. Both were delicious. And let me tell you, if you are a beets fan get that caprese. UH-mazing. I got the creole cole slaw and the quinoa salad as sides. The cole slaw was fine; really I''m not that into cabbage anyway. But the quinoa was great.

I have almost 200 restaurants on  my New Orleans Collection that we still want to eat at and we have been to Saba 5 times. It is rare for us to repeat places to eat here. That being said, clearly the number of times we have eaten at Saba is an indicator of how good we think it is, and it is that good! We had never had a meal here that was not the best we have eaten of whatever it was. For example the best falafel or the best schnitzel we have eaten.

Unfortunately this time was not quite up to par. It was still delicious, but the falafel was not the best we have ever eaten.  It was coarse, grainy and dense. When we have had it before here it was light and airy with no grittiness. Did someone forget the baking powder? The color was off too. It''s usually super bright green, but was dark Christmas tree green this time. Helen didn''t want to eat all of it. 

We always order several Salatim and this visit was no different. We ordered the Ikra, Lutenitsa, Heirloom Confit Tomatoes and Mushroom Hummus. Everything was super good. You should get the mushroom hummus, you really should. It is fantastic and the blend of spices on it is unbelievably delicious. 
Helen''s entry was the falafel. I ordered the Lamb Kofta and L.S. ate the Salatim. Mine was some of the best lamb ever, and there was nowhere near enough Latke. It was fantastic! It actually was plenty, I just wanted more. The fried egg yolk was a nice touch and added some richness to everything.

This menu really spoke to me. After getting some recommendations from our server, we ended up going with the Brussel Sprouts Hummus, the Lutenitsa, Moroccan Carrots, Fall Squash Fattoush, and the Lamb Kofta. Every item was outstanding, but I have to say that nothing hit the spot as much as the Pita. It''s truly perfection -- so fluffy with the perfect amount of chew. I seriously could have eaten this alone and been a happy camper.

The Brussel Sprouts Hummus was fantastic -- I''m a big sucker for brussel sprouts and the flavor was infused throughout. The Lutenitsa was also another fantastic dip, while both the Moroccan Carrots and Fall Squash Fattoush were hearty, veggie-forward dishes. The Lamb Kofta was another showstopper and was so tender and flavorful. 

As for drinks, I got the Red Sea. This cocktail didn''t blow my mind in any way, and it ended up being a tad too tart for my liking, but I still enjoyed it. For dessert, we went with the Cookie Plate, which was a great little sweet treat assortment to end the meal with :'').', 60, 5, 8);

We got the Tabbouleh, Blue Crab Hummus, and Crudite.

The Tabbouleh was a smaller portion than I anticipated but it was very fresh. I''ve never had pecans in it before and it added a nice crunch.

The Blue Crab Hummus was yummy especially with the hints of lemon. I do wish there were larger chunks of blue crab. The pita that is brought by is always the star of the meal - a hot, fluffy pocket of deliciousness.

Add a hummus or two. We got the hummus with roasted Brussels sprouts. So good and and fresh. The hummus with spicy lamb ragu was also a good non vegetarian option. Perfect to dip with the fresh pita bread. 

The fresh Fatoush salad with summer squash was so nice and refreshing. Loved the baby squash and butter lettuce.

For mains, the eggplant was a light bite. The lamb kabob on whipped tahini was good as well.

Full disclosure: My visit was years ago. This restaurant has a fun and lively vibe and the service was friendly. They specialize in cajun / creole food. I would also say based on our experience and the food, this is personally  my favorite restaurant in New Orleans (circa 2015 (?)). The food is flavorful and reasonably priced and feel like its a product of the terroir. 

It''s the type of restaurant if one person told me it is authentic and a locals favorite and another person told me it''s super touristy and kitschy, I probably would believe both. Which is what actually happened to me with two different people who grew up in New Orleans and/or Louisiana. It should be noted, however, that the person who said it was touristy is the type of person who calls any restaurant outside of fast food chains ''hipster''. The person who rec''d it to me and loved it is fun and positive. Also, I was a tourist. Plain and simple. The combination of the energy, environment, and food was just perfect for me. 

I came here during my brother''s bachelor party/ getaway. We came here with a sizeable group (approx 10 if I recall) and were seated outside. There was a bit of a wait to get the table ready, but we got drinks next door. With that said, maybe a part of our positive experience was that we had a large jovial group and just added to the vibe/ experience. It might be different if you are looking for a one-on-one intimate experience. 

To start, we ordered some items like the cornbread and shrimp/ alligator cheesecake. Usually, I''m not a fan of reptile, but when in Rome! I thought the cheesecake was good and the cornbread was great. For my entrée, I got the ''Godzilla'', which was a large soft shell crab with fried green tomatoes. Not sure if it''s one the menu anymore, but it was tasty. The sides - the beans/ rice/ greens... these are the type of sides/ food I look for in a place when I think New Orleans and all were done very well. 

A very memorable night for our group. It''s a place I will make a point to go back when I''m back in "The Big Easy"', 75, 5, 10);

The scene is unique. The bar at the entrance has framed pictures tacked onto the ceiling. The chandeliers are made from recycled Mardi Gras beads. There''s definitely an eclectic, artsy vibe here and I totally dig it. 

To get through the main dining room, you have to walk through the kitchen. It''s kind of neat to see because you can get a glance of the action. It''s busy, bustling and it all smells amazing. 

For starters we ordered rabbit tenderloin and fried green tomatoes. The tenderloin was delicious. The fried green tomatoes were ok. 

Then it was onto our entrees. My coworker mentioned that I try the Louisiana Redfish so I did just that. My goodness! The Redfish was phenomenally memorable. I loved it. 

Redfish when prepared well has a subtle flavor and the texture is very light and delicate. The crab chili hollandaise sauce it came in was so delicious and added an additional layer of flavor. I ate it all up and did not have leftovers to take home because it was that damn delicious. 

The husband ordered one of their special entrees, The Stuffed Pork Chop. It had hot sausage, beef, shrimp and mushroom gravy. He said it was good however it would''ve been perfect had it not been overcooked. 

For dessert they brought out a bread pudding and so far on this trip, I haven''t had a terrible bread pudding. Every place has their own spin on this dessert and Jacque-Imo''s did a fantastic job executing this one too.

The ambiance here is super cute and I was seated at the area near to the kitchen. I had a good time while there, talking with staff members and even connecting with another guest. 

For starters I ordered some coffee and as was my entire experience in NOLA, the coffee did not disappoint one bit! Freshly brewed and I even got a cup to go. 

Entree: I think I overate but who cares lol this is one of those places where the food is so darn good, you''ll want to keep eating. 

I ordered the most delicious crab omelette which came loaded with crab meat and a side of crispy and perfectly seasoned potatoes. I didn''t care much for the asparagus on top but it did add a little "eat your greens" to my meal. I rate this meal 1000/100 because it was everything worth trying. 

Now the star of show was the pancakes, let me tell you babyyyyyyy, I''m a pancake addict and you know that it''s good when you bite into it fluffy pancakes all you immediately taste the flavor, butter and syrup. I mean it! These were the BEST pancakes I''ve ever had! I''m still trying to figure out another reason to go back to NOLA before the year ends and somehow end up here lol BEST pancakes hands down!

The menu is basic.   You have a selection of empanadas, in mostly unique flavors (hey  breakfast beschamel and beef bourginon empanadas, I''m looking at the two of you!), a trio of sauces to choose from, and some basic beverages.  You order what you want (averaging maybe $4 a piece, or you can get combos with multiples, soup, or salad type things), and they pop it in the conveyor oven and it''s served hot and fresh right there for you.

The interior is intimate and warm, perfect for a date night bite, or 4 friends grabbing a meal. Based on earlier reviews, it looks like they recently renovated and I can confirm everything looked nice enough. 

The menu offers 6 or so appetizers, 6 or so pastas, and 4 protein forward mains. 
(Appetizers $13-$18, Pastas $25-$32, and Entrees $29-$60 per dish FYI)  
We started with the crispy calamari and the fried eggplant as appetizers. The eggplant was very good, but the calamari was the start of our troubles. It was extremely salty. I love salt. My wife loves salt. We have salt problems when snacking, and we both couldn''t eat more than one bite, it was that salty. Burn your mouth salty.  All 4 of us at the table agreed that the dish was too salty, but we just chalked it up as an accidental heavy hand with salting it coming out of the fryer, and like the eggplant, everything else will be great. 

My wife ordered the Rigatoni, I ordered the Cacio E Pepe, another table mate ordered the Chicken Picatta, and I''ve already forgotten what the 4th ordered. 
I was very excited for the Cacio E Pepe. It''s one of my favorite Roman dishes, and something I often jump on when I find it on a menu. I spun up a big forkful, popped it in my mouth, and there was that salt again. I chewed through it, tried another big spin of noodles, and yup wayyyyy too salty. It tasted as if someone thought it would be fun to prank our table, not just one dash too many, but a pile of salt. 
I looked over at my wife, and she had taken one bite of her food and stopped eating altogether. Same problem. 
The other tablemate who ordered the chicken, also felt it was too salty to her taste but not as bad as mine nor my wife''s. 
(We started tasting each others dishes it was so weirdly salty, that I wanted to double check I wasn''t just making this up in my head) 

After my two big spins of my noodles and sharing a bite to others at the table, it looked like I didn''t have an issue with my plate since it was half gone... So, I let the server know the best I could that this was inedible salty, but I obviously pointed out that I had made a big dent in it so I wasn''t asking for free food on the check or anything. I also pointed out that my wife''s almost completely untouched plate was also too salty, and mentioned the other salty dishes we had run across along the way. I was trying to share a serious concern, and just looking at my wife''s one bite and done plate, it should have been obvious something was wrong.  
Our server more or less just said "thanks for the feedback, I''ll let them know", and that was that. There wasn''t much of an attempt to fix the night from management, or the kitchen, and essentially no one acknowledging our issue after that. 

There were some mistaken drink orders, and other weird service blunders, but I''m sure we were just hyper aware of stuff since we were already irked about dinner going so poorly. Our only specific complaint about the service was at the end of the night with the bill. Our friend offered to get the whole check, and the server handed her the card reader tableside and told her she went ahead and put 20% tip on the bill, and then hovered over her to watch her accept and sign. That just struck us as uncomfortably pushy, and after everything else going so poorly that night (and lack of anyone addressing it) it was just the last straw.

This comes with no surprise because this shop is one of the few Japanese restaurants in New Orleans run by actual Japanese owners. It''s a must try spot for anyone who loves ramen!

The ramen is as authentic to Japan as you can get in New Orleans. We tried the miso and the tonkotsu, and they were both fantastic! Taste-wise phenomenal, portions were generous, and the prices were very fair ($14). I loved the tonkotsu and can''t recommend it enough, but my boyfriend loved the miso more. They cook their pork bones for the broth for two whole days here, so the broth is just packed full of that rich decadent flavor you need in ramen. As a side note, we also tried the oyako-donburi ($12). Delicious! Tastes like my grandma''s home-cooking in Japan!

General overview, this is a super cute casual space with cafeteria-style dining. Meaning, you order and pay at the counter and help yourself to drinks. They will bring the food to your table, but then you toss the trash and bring the dirty dishes to their bins yourself after you''re done. I actually love and prefer it this way. (This might be how they keep their menu prices so reasonable compared to other Japanese places!) The space is decorated with tons of plants and lights for a cozy feel. It feels like a comfy day-time coffee shop, but they are open for meals only from 3pm to 9pm. I''ve been told the restaurant started off exclusively doing pop-ups at festivals, and they decided to open up a permanent location a few years ago. If it hadn''t been for the pandemic, I probably would have heard about this spot sooner! This is a family-owned shop where you''ll probably get to meet the mother/daughter duo.

Apps course
--The Butternut Shrimp Bisque;    was the blend of 2 great bisque''s. matched perfectly and velvety light. Flavors abound from that great gulf shrimp and chef''s seasoning. Bravo!
--New Orleans BBQ Shrimp wiith Shrimp Calas (Creole rice fritter) was another Homerun de gastric!  ( we split this one just to get chef''s version of a classic)
--The Veal Sweetbreads- with Mushrooms, Capers, & Lemon Roasted Garlic Butter;  I haven''t had sweetbreads since I worked in a restaurant as a teenager. This was one of the best dishes I have had in a long time...in any city. Just amazing and plentiful.
We then had a simple house salad course that left us thinking. What was that light dressing made from. So light, falvorful. Not acidic at all. Such a nice refresher.
Entree course 
--Brigtsen''s Seafood Platter-- Grilled redfish w/ shrimp & smoked cashew sauce- Shrimp cornbread w/ smoked corn butter- Baked oyster Fortuna- Baked scallop with Herbsaint spinach- shrimp & cucuzza dressing;   an array of the chef''s creativity. a great way to experience a lot of the flavors of New Orleans. 
--Roast Duck  ala orange & dirty rice;   a huge piece of this succulent fowl ( half duck!) with perfectly crisped skin. The rice had a nice little spice kick to it. Some seasons chef serves this with a tart cherry sauce.
Dessert
We split probably the best pecan pie we''ve had in memory. Of course all desserts are house made but this was a dream. Not hat tacky, sticky, over-sweet confection that most places serve. Truly a nice, light, way to end a perfect meal.
Our waiter introduced us to Nocello. An after dinner liquor based on walnut. Light, not too sweet. Delish!

The highlight of my visit was the Blackened Tuna Sandwich. The moment it arrived at the table, I was captivated by the vibrant colors and enticing aroma. The tuna was perfectly seared, creating a beautiful contrast between the blackened exterior and the tender, rare center. The accompanying slaw added a refreshing crunch, and the house-made remoulade sauce tied everything together with a delightful spicy kick. It was a harmonious symphony of flavors, and I could hardly put it down.

But the culinary adventure didn''t stop there. The Crawfish Boiled Fried Chicken Biscuit was a revelation. This dish is the epitome of Southern comfort food with a creative twist. The fried chicken was crispy and succulent, and the spicy aioli drizzle combined with honey created a delectable sweet and spicy marriage that left me craving more. It was an indulgence worth every calorie.

The sides at Picnic Provisions are not to be overlooked. The Potato Salad was creamy and well-seasoned, making for the perfect accompaniment to the bold flavors of the main dishes. The Corn Salad, on the other hand, was a light and refreshing contrast with its bright, crisp kernels and zesty dressing.

What sets Picnic Provisions apart is its charming, relaxed atmosphere.

I had gone in expecting to order the tofu-mushroom pho that is both satisfying and healthy.   Instead I ended up trying the kimchee burger with sweet potato fries (because, after all, sweet potatoes are healthy, too.)  

The burger was first rate: it had a perfect exterior char,was cooked exactly to medium-rare. The surprisingly well-seasoned flavor and juiciness reminded me of the first "gourmet burger" I ever had as a young diner at Ground Pat''i in the 1970s.  

Pickled cabbage would not have been my first choice for a burger topping, but now it''s on the list alongside mushroom-swiss and lettuce-tomato-cheddar as a favored way to garnish a patty.   

There are vegan and vegetarian options all across the menu, if both carnivores and plant-only folks comprise your dining party. Mint is an excellent choice.

The vermicelli is excellent for those looking for something other than a giant (and delicious) pho soup.  I did note that majority of patrons on the cold evening we visited did opt for pho.  But if you''re looking for a burger, consider Mint.  

The sweet potato fries were among the best I''ve had in memory: crisp, hot, fresh, and cooked perfectly.

Crawfish Queso - this was really good. Not too heavy on the crawfish, but a good balance with the Queso. Perfect for sharing.

Guacamole - honestly some of the best guacamole I''ve ever had. Smooth texture. Strong lime taste. Perfect for sharing.

Pork Arepas - this came with 2 of them. It was kind of a sandwich where the bread was a bit crunchier. This was good.

Paella - this was kind of a Spanish jambalaya. It had chicken, sausage, shrimp, muscles, along with the rice / seasonings.

Service was quick and responsive, but they''re mostly going to let you make your own decisions (rather than making recommendations or explaining the menu, etc).

Parking - since it''s off canal you really are going to have to pay for parking. I''d prioritize coming here when you already were coming for a show at the Saenger or the Joy theater (or on of the other places near by).

The location is perfect for me, as I love the riverbend, but that''s kind of where the high point lies.

My husband and I parked across the street on Oak, paid the meter, and made our way inside. We were welcomed and shown to our seats at the bar area. No tables available - this is a counter seating concept. No good for conversation with friends, business associates or family members. The menus were on the bar and I was surprised that hand rolls were really the only offered entrees. It was lunchtime and I was hungry. As very few of the hand roll ingredients were familiar to me, the server/hostess answered the questions I had about the menu items.  I got tired of asking questions. I felt dumb and like a bother, so I just shut my mouth and moved on. 

The server/hostess explained that each handroll would be equal to a sushi roll in size and quantity, and that they could not be cut by the sushi chef so my husband and I could just take turns biting into them. Seriously? I''m still so confused. Thank goodness I was having lunch with my husband because I certainly wouldn''t eat after anyone else. Gross.

We initially ordered 3 rolls - 
Blue crab - super smushed crab - and not like snow crab. More like blue crab after you pick it, but imagine it all smushed and gray. 
Blue fin Toro - it was ok, but not great 
Salmon - not too bad, but not great

These rolls were so small and sparsely filled that we were left very hungry. We ordered another roll - the Shiitake. It was by far our favorite of the four, but unfortunately it was extremely salty.

The prices are outrageous. We had the four rolls mentioned and stuck with tap water. Our bill was 85.90. Keep in mind that the total includes the 18% gratuity that is added to all checks. I''ve attached a pic.

I absolutely over-ordered, got the arancini, the red shrimp, and the grilled oysters. All were really delicious with the shrimp being my favorite. The oysters had more of a mussel flavor to them and I almost mistook the dish for escargots. For entrees, ordered the mushroom pasta and ribeye. The pasta was amazing, great flavors and hardy mushrooms which add a ton of texture. The ribeye was really good...not sure if it''s 75$ good so might avoid that on future visits.

It seems like a popular choice for a special occasion restaurant as we saw many tables celebrating a birthday or another event. I would say the dress code is Smart Casual.

We started with the Peace Crudo and the Nduja Arancini. The crudo that night was fatty tuna and it was very melt-in-you-mouth soft. The fish was very fresh and the lemon adds freshness.

The Arancini was crispy on the outside and had salty cheese and pickled peppers on the inside.

I got the Campanelle that was a mushroom lover''s dream! It contained multiple types of mushrooms - I appreciated seeing shiitake on the menu as I don''t see that too commonly outside of Asian cuisine. Each bite was full of umami and I loved this dish.

The Radiatori was also amazing - the basil was super fresh and not overpowering considering how much there was.

We saw many people ordering pizzas, namely the Davila, spicy Calabrian one. It is a very large serving so for two people it could absolutely be a meal. I was not impressed with it though. The spicy sauce was drizzled all over and too powerful. My fiancé loves spicy food and he said the sauce was overkill. In addition to this sauce, there were jalepenos throughout. I would suggest to try one of the other two pizzas.

We sat outside on a gorgeous day, and that is hard to beat. Service was prompt once we were seated and we placed our orders. We had the glass noodle and seaweed salad, pork floss dumplings, and the soup dumplings. 

The salad came out quickly and was delicious and a generous portion. $5.00.  The pork floss and soup dumplings arrived next at the same time. Pork floss was a delightful mound of shredded, airy bits of pork on top of the dumplings.  We saved the soup dumplings for last, and I''m glad we did, because they were still screaming hot by the time we got to them. I enjoyed everything and thought they had a great flavor. No, they aren''t as good as soup dumplings in NYC or San Francisco, but I wasn''t expecting that. 

Perhaps my tastes are simple, but I was surprised to read the critical reviews complaining of a lack of flavor, etc. I thought there was plenty of flavor, and I''m a person who uses hot sauce religiously.

For dessert, we tried the strawberry and Oreo chantilly cake slices.

Needing a break from the Po Boys, I decided to come here for dinner one evening, and found the restaurant quite quiet. Just me, and other customer. That normally is not a good sign, until I met and started talking to one of the owners, Moncef.

Moncef is an absolute doll, a treasure, a Tunisian man with a heart of gold. He is also Jamila''s husband, but if he is good, then I am sure so is she. He asked me how I found out about this restaurant, and I told him through some research (same with the food I ordered). I will get back to him later in this review, but I have to get to the food part first.

The Crawfish, Zucchini & Spinach Bisque soup is fantastic. I got it as an appetizer and it is nothing short of amazing. The herbal taste, combined with crawfish in every bite, make it worth getting again and again. I should also mention you get complementary bread, some pita and French bread, appropriate for the cuisine.

For my main course, I ordered the Tajine of Lamb, better known as Lamb Tajine. I will be honest, the lamb is a bit dry, but once you put it over the rice, and pour the juices over the meat, it creates an experience that is rather unforgettable. I let Moncef know this.

I also let Moncef know how kind he treated me, giving me baskets of free bread and willing to make my experience extra special with any small request. He responded with something so profound that I have not forgotten it.

"It doesn''t cost anything to be nice."

He is so right, and it is why Moncef is worth getting mentioned in this review. Good food, excellent service, all at a cost of an amazing man.

We all are tourists once we leave our environs. I visit a loved one in New Orleans. (People on other websites love to point out tourists.)

I''d read good and not so good reviews. Worried they would be snobby. Wondering if I''d be dressed nice enough. But one review stood out: He/she had one of the best date nights here. Luckily, mine copy and pasted the latter.

Initially seated in main room. Back in the left corner. The rowdy conversations and acoustics were overwhelming. Even before pouring our water, the kind man who seated us somehow knew something was off and I was distressed. (That main room is something else. It''s as if everyone is shouting.) He swiftly, but without pretension, moved us to the room next to the bar.

From reading, I knew to ask for the soft shell crab as not on the menu. I felt like the luckiest kid at Christmas when he retorted indeed they had it that night. I unwrapped the gift I wanted. I think I did a big YES. One of the most memorable meals of my life. Memorable because it was 50/50. 50 for the meal. 50 for the staff. Of course the soft shell was divine as were the vegetables served...and the martini. But what made it so memorable: the staff. Very kind and attentive. Very genuine. Not once did my water glass go unfilled. Staff nearby, but not stuck up. I haven''t had such attentive and kind service in decades. I grew up going to restaurants in Chicago. It reminded me of those restaurant times. Where the meal and amazing staff go hand-in-hand. I suppose at some point I''ll hit up the holy Trinity in the FQ, but I can''t wait to come back to Clancy''s at Christmas.

I thought of two people as I dined: Tom Wolfe, the author, and Anthony Bourdain. Not sure why. Wouldn''t be surprised if Wolfe had a meal or two at Clancy''s. I did ask our kind server about Bourdain and he said to his knowledge, he never visited. He would have loved it. I also thought of a book I read long ago: Hug Your Customers by Jack Mitchell from the department store in Ct. I know, corny title. But on the plane ride home, I kept trying to figure out where I''d read or felt something like this. It was this book and restaurants I visited as a kid in Chicago. So I was lucky to have one of the best dining experiences in a very long time. The soft shell and the incredible staff.

PS - I also LOVED the staff at Bluemercury. I''ve been into the skincare game a long time. Used to visit their only store in DC back in late 90''s. Fully expected them to be stuck up. Anything but. So kind and attentive. Can''t wait to go back. No one had attitude.

Next came the wood fire puppy drum and the shiitake crusted scallops. The drum was one of the best I''ve ever had. We were getting full but we still had an order of Kashmiri fried chicken coming. They gave us a small ginger salad to enjoy with the chicken. Everything was perfectly spiced and delicious.

INSERT INTO yelp.review VALUES (4532, 'I came here on a Monday night, and found that reservations were easy to make. The menu was very funky, in that I''ve never heard of or tasted these combinations of flavors before. We kind of went based on the server''s recommendations, which were the Kashmiri Fried chicken, the pork lumpia (which came on a cart), and the pani puri. We also had the green chili verde. Overall I highly recommend the pani puri. We were pleasantly surprised to see a strawberry sitting there in a savory cocoon of indian-inspired flavors. It was also interactive in that it involved pouring over this herbaceous green secret sauce that layered yet another interesting flavor.

We also ordered their seasonal dessert - a sundae with oatmeal ice cream and blackberry (sauce? compote?) - When I tell you it blew my mind, it was just so creative! The serving size was larger than I expected but my favorite part was the little bites of cookie in there. Just wow.

I found that Mr. Mao''s flavors were refreshingly bold and daring, while still nodding to Asian street food/culture. As someone who is building up her tolerance to spice very slowly, I thought the menu was excellent. I think I would have added either a beer or a cocktail to cut through the spice but since it was a Monday night, I chose not to go that route. Most of their menu is meant to be shared, but you can also order from the little pushcart menu which offer smaller plates. I loved being able to sample different dishes. Though they weren''t the cheapest in price, it felt like you paid for the experience and the genius behind the cuisine! 

Lastly -- I want to comment on the ambience. The vibe is cozy, hip, and almost secretive! The door to enter was unmarked and hidden from the signage and as soon as you walk in it felt like you were in someone''s house enjoying a secret meal. The only thing I wish that the dishes had was some sort of neutral sauce or something on the side that would cut through all of the bold flavors, but that might be my personal preference.

INSERT INTO yelp.review VALUES (4535, 'We had a date night at TANA within the first few weeks of opening and the Food was FANTASTIC! 

Before getting to the food- some things to keep in mind- it can get fairly loud, we were a party of two and at times we could not hear each other while seated across from each other, which likely was due to how busy it was. This restaurant was very busy on a Sunday evening and I think the service reflected this. Even with this in mind we were seated within 10 minutes of our reservation. We did order everything up front and there was little revisiting from our server until the initial meal was over, so do try to keep this in mind if you want to add to your order. We felt as though the food came out timely and in a very organized manner separated by courses with a small duration of time in between that was perfect for us and did not feel rushed. As that the restaurant still is in its initial stage of opening I feel as though this all will improve over time.

The food as mentioned was FANTASTIC- 

The drinks were great, we enjoyed the TANA Negroni and the Mezcal cocktail (now a personal favorite!) 

You do have bread, butter, and oil to start. We started with the appetizer of the meatballs and the crudo. Both had good flavor. The meatballs were tender and had enough cheese and sauce to accompany them. For the Crudo we particularly enjoyed the Satsuma that complimented it, it was very fresh and light. 

CANNOT SPEAK HIGH ENOUGH of the Caesar salad, between us both it was the best Caesar salad we have ever had- 

Both the pasta courses that we had tried the Radiatore in Red Gravy and Gulf Shrimp Paccheri were both great and very balanced in flavors with fairly large portion sizes. Pasta was cooked very well.

As our own personal tradition, we always order tiramisu as a dessert at every Italian restaurant, and Tana''s tiramisu even though non-traditional did not disappoint. It was amazing though very filling and rich so splitting it was the perfect balance following our dinner.

All and all TANA is a fantastic restaurant and a gem in Old Metairie-  it is a must add on your list if you enjoy Italian cuisine and we will be back soon as it is now one of our new favorites!', 540, 5, 72);

Ambience is beautiful but quite loud. Request a booth with cushioned seating and you will be much more comfortable. Regular chairs have a bottom seat that is too long for the human body and most uncomfortable.

Cobia crudo ($21). Some flaky salt would''ve really elevated this dish. The oil and all was very tasty but oil versus amount of cobia given didn''t add up. 

Pasta Con Vongole Nola ($27). Throughly enjoyed this dish. Light seafood broth with acidic/ orange notes ? Reminds me of a seafood boil with noodles. Hot sausage crumbles remind me of Pattons. 

Smoked Pork Cappelletti with Blue Crab Crema ($27). Another dish throughly enjoyed. Reminds me of a bougie shrimp Alfredo but with crab and lots of Cajun inspo. 

Veal Marsala ($34) + truffle shavings ($30). SKIP the truffle upsell. It does not enhance the dish and if anything, the black pepper is very overpowering and you do not taste the truffle. Bubs kept saying it''s like a healthy version of country fried steak. was a little salty, recommend getting a side of buttered noodles or rice to complement and tone down the saltiness.

Zucchini ($9). I enjoyed the overall flavor of the side. The marcona almonds add a nice crunch. I wish the zucchini wasn''t so over cooked and still had a bite to it. Dish had a lot of residue oil which made it less appealing.

Our experience at Gautreau''s can be summed up with three words; boring, dated and uninspired. The restaurant is nice both inside and out, and we were seated promptly. The service was way below standard. Pretty terrible to be honest. As for the food, I made sure to try as much as I could to get the full Gautreau''s experience. Salad, soup and three different proteins. Unfortunately, the dishes left me reaching for the bread more often than not. It was a very disappointing, underwhelming experience to say the least. When dining at a "fine dining" establishment, you expect to be blown away by the flavor and technique of the dishes, but that never happened. Below are the dishes we had.

Arugula, Heirloom Tomato, Cucumber, Red Onion and Lebna - very small and basic dish. Lebna smeared carelessly beneath a mass of room temp arugula and semi-soggy tomatoes. 3/10

Soup du jour- I can not remember all of the ingredients of the dish, but it was a cold soup with lump crab meat. Flavor was just ok, spiced nicely and flavor profile mimicked dishes you would have in Indian cuisine. 3/10

Red Snapper with Chinese Egg Noodles and Coconut Miso Broth - once again, a very bland dish. Fish was cooked nicely, but under seasoned. Without the coconut miso broth, I probably wouldn''t have eaten more than one bite. Poor execution of what could be a great dish. 4/10

Duck Confit with Black Lentils and Chiriboga
Blue Cheese caramelized pears and Vidalia onion, piquillo peppers and brandy jus - Im honestly surprised this dish had this many ingredients because it was a black mass of bland on a plate.
Each bite tasted of pure lentil. Duck was over cooked, flavorless and dry. If there was any positive note on this dish, it was the crispy skin on the duck.
Extremely sub par dish. 2/10

Roasted Chicken with Shiitakes, haricots verts and mashed potatoes - dish was the highlight of the meal. Good flavor, chicken was cooked well and the shiitakes added a nice earthiness to the dish. Pretty good, but not something I couldn''t do myself. 4/10

My wife asked if they had General''s chicken and she said they did but it ended up being Orange chicken. The white rice was extremely soggy! My wife was upset. Any good Asian restaurant should pride themselves on their white rice. This was not the case. The hot and sour soup was only available in a large size and for $15.

The "General''s" chicken was a small portion for $23 and barely shareable; soup was $15.

The kitchen is simply a miracle. How does this chef keep turning out perfection, year after year, every night!?  
Started with lobster gnocchi. Little house made clouds combined with lobster in a buttery sauce, yum! 
Next we had Parsnip soup. Full of delicious parsnip flavor made even more flavorful with the addition of Parmesan and thick salty pieces of crisp bacon. 
Shared a warm spinach salad. This was dressed perfectly and completed with walnuts and more salty bacon-yum! 
The filet was seared and perfectly cooked, resulting in melt in your mouth perfection. The au jus was superb and perfect for the purred potatoes.  
We also had the "Porcini dusted" chicken with risotto. Is there any better chicken dish in North America? I doubt it!  The broiled chicken''s crispy salted skin made even more delicious by its mushroom dusting. This skin was covering a deboned piece of juicy chicken breast with bone-in leg attached providing  added flavor during cooking. The au jus here is made of the bird''s renderings and marries perfectly to the risotto. I could eat this every night for the rest of my life, and I almost never have chicken. Crazy good!!

The burger tastes very similar to one I get at an old food stand (that is on my way to my grandparents house in Mississippi that has been around since the ''50s) and they have always used local grass fed beef and I can get their very similar burger for about $3.  You can also get a very similar and less expensive burger at The Camellia Grill or Clover Grill.  I might return but it won''t be very often as at the current price level far bigger and better burgers are a far better choice.

FYI the meat for burgers here comes from Creekstone Farms which is advertised as "all natural, hormone & antibiotic free" and is fed on a "vegetarian diet" but corn is a vegetable so they can still corn fatten the cows and meet this criteria.  So this standard doesn''t mean the same thing as "grass fed" and "grass finished beef" which is the gold standard much healthier for you and has higher omega-3 fatty acids than fish!

The bar menu boasted an impressive selection of wines, not just your run-of-the-mill offerings. The cocktail list was equally unique and perfectly captured the Mid-City vibe. They even had Paradise Park on tap, a simple draft beer that satisfied my father-in-law''s classic taste.

Our oldest devoured the corndog but loved the resturantour''s son''s hand drawn kids menu which included fun activities like hangman and word scrambles. We were bummed we didn''t get a chance to try the kid''s charcuterie board.

I believe this may be the answer.

  I ordered the beef and chicken and the flavor profile was very nice, i could tell the soup had simmered for a while to gain flavor. The umami flavors were my favorite part and when I bit into the chicken there was a hint of sweet.

I say we have found another queen of yakamein in town. We have room for 2 great women with 2 great recipes.

They let me sample the sweet potato pie and it was very good and i would recommend that if you want a sweet treat afterwards.

  They also brought me a sample of the shrimp. It was seasoned well, but the shrimp was bit over. With less cook on the shrimp it would be nice.

In really enjoyed the owners and talking with them the staff are friendly and helpful.

The serving size was more than you get at  Jazzfest so I can see why they charge more than some may like. It will easily be 2 meals for me.  And it would great to share 2 different soups or a po-boy.

They also have different salads regular and the special Yaka-mein po-boy. A person who order this said it was very good.

I live off of Tulane Ave., so I''m always excited to see a new business open up.

The good:

The staff is as friendly as all get out.  Very welcoming and kind.  I enjoyed talking with the gentleman working the counter as he assured me that I was going to LOVE yakamein!

The ok:

The restaurant itself is pretty small. While there are tables if you choose to dine in, this place is probably better suited just to stop in and pick up a to go order.

The yakamein itself was tasty, but to warn...it''s insanely salty. I''m used to how salty pho and ramen are, so I was prepared for the salt. In fact, it''s one of the reasons why I love pho and ramen so much.  But...I was unable to eat this yakamein without adding water to it.  Once I did that, it was very good.

The bad:
No other way to put it...the price.  It''s very expensive. The chicken and shrimp yakamein was $20.  So, with tax and tip, you''re looking at $23.  

I get that prices are high everywhere. Ramen houses are charging $15-$18 for ramen and Vietnamese places are charging $13-$16 for pho...but that''s in a full-service restaurant with wait staff...not a small counter service place that is best suited for take-out. 

With it not being a full-service restaurant with wait staff, their prices should reflect that. If they were more appropriately priced at $13-14, they could have an all-day revolving door of business. At $20, I fear that they won''t make it, and that makes me sad because it was tasty and the people that work there are great.', 680, 3, 90);

First, the basics:
1.) The food I had during my visit was fiyah. The chicken skin and exterior batter was satisfyingly crunchy, and the chicken itself was still flavorful and moist. 
2.) I didn''t wait in a long line, and service was satisfactory. 

As a Mississippi native, I think what Willie Mae''s does best is serve as a great ambassador for Louisiana and Mississippi cuisine for the masses of people who will never eat our legendary and regionally famous gas station chicken, juke joint chicken, tailgate chicken, grocery store chicken, or my mom''s immaculate and perfectly seasoned chicken that''s fried in the true masterpiece: a cast iron skillet.

INSERT INTO yelp.review VALUES (4720, 'I recently visited Guy''s Po Boys in Uptown New Orleans and I must say, it is truly a hidden gem. As a local, I have been to many po boy shops in the city, but Guy''s stands out for its authentic flavors and attention to detail.

One of the highlights of Guy''s Po Boys is their use of real Leidenheimer bread. This bread is a staple in New Orleans and adds a unique and delicious touch to their sandwiches. The bread is always fresh and perfectly complements the fillings.

Speaking of fillings, Guy''s Po Boys uses only the freshest ingredients in their sandwiches. Whether you''re a fan of roast beef, shrimp, or oyster po boys, you can rest assured that the ingredients are of the highest quality. The flavors are rich and the portions are generous, making each bite a true delight.

What sets Guy''s Po Boys apart from other shops is the personal touch of the owner. You can tell that he takes pride in his craft and puts a lot of effort into creating the perfect sandwich. The sandwiches are always well-crafted and bursting with flavor.

However, it''s important to note that the wait at Guy''s Po Boys can be quite long. With everything made fresh, it''s understandable that it takes time to prepare each order. On average, you can expect to wait around 20 minutes. Additionally, the seating area is limited, so it''s best to plan accordingly or opt for takeout.

Despite the wait and limited seating, Guy''s Po Boys is definitely worth a visit. The authentic flavors, fresh ingredients, and perfectly crafted sandwiches make it one of the best po boy shops in the city.', 725, 5, 96);

Side note: the bathroom is very cool as well lol, mirrors everywhere! 

Anyways, the food. We ordered family style and shared the:

- artichoke hearts on the half shell: presentation was cute. the artichokes are served on oyster shell dishes and almost look like chargrilled oysters (kinda taste a little like them also?? Or maybe that''s just placebo haha). These were delicious.

- crudo: this was one of my favorite items on the menu. Lots of different flavors going on, and overall the dish is very light and refreshing 

- veal sweetbreads: also good. lots of different textures with the crisp of the breading mixed with the fattiness of the veal, along with several different types of crunch provided by peanut, puffed rice, and bean sprouts. I really enjoyed the veggie/dressing component of this dish. 

- fried crab boil potatoes with tartar sauce - tastes exactly like it sounds. I wish the potatoes were a **tad** crispier 

- daily special: seared scallops in this light sauce with southeast Asian flavors and spice. So good! Probably one of my favorite things we had. I wish this were a permanent fixture on the menu! 

- DRINKS: claro que tea was light and almost tasted reminiscent of a white wine or rose to me. Pandan old fashioned was actually so good. I''m not a huge bourbon fan, but I loved how much the pandan flavor lingered after each sip.

The ambiance is a mix of dark industrial with plant tones here and there, would make for a good date spot except it''s a bit loud. You needed a reservation on the night that we went as we saw several parties walking out discouraged by the lack of walk-in availability. Now onto the food:

Curry beignet w/ tom yum cream cheese - WHAT?! The beignet itself was pretty good but completely overshadowed by the maddeningly craveable CC. I had to get more of that addictive CC for the next dish.

Sesame annatto buns - freshly baked dinner rolls that come with whipped butter and shellfish pepper jelly. Again, WHAT?! The pepper jelly is an incredible flavor bomb (arguably my wife''s favorite bite of the meal) but also needs the rich creaminess of the butter, and the buns themselves come fresh out of the oven and are so, so good.

Tuna kinilaw - essentially Filipino ceviche with a little coconut milk, great contrast to the richness of the other dishes.

Grilled romanesco cauliflower - good char and great orange tapenade, again necessary to cut through the fat of the heavier plates.

Nuoc mam caramel glazed pork shoulder - this was the dish on the menu that convinced me to step in the door. The exterior of the meat is nice and crispy while the interior is fork tender; the seasoning is both sweet and salty, and definitely needs some carb and some acid to mellow out the strong but delicious flavors.

Coconut crab spaghetti - the flavors of this dish hit me like a truck. It''s similar to uni (sea urchin) cream pasta but with the texture of more al dente spaghetti and obviously replacing slightly briny uni with the mild and creamy coconut plus delicate and sweet crabmeat. Probably my favorite dish of the night.

Fried cereal milk custard - the mochi-like fried cereal coating around the surprisingly solid milk custard, with a small pool of passionfruit preserve sitting on top, are banging as a whole; I found the miso cremeux milk crumb to be too salty even when consumed with the other components of the dessert, and the ice cream could''ve used just a bit more lemongrass to help it stand out a little more.

Pot de creme - faint hints of coconut and pandan in a light and airy chocolate dessert of whipped pudding consistency. My wife typically doesn''t care much for chocolate but she liked this dessert a lot. Not as sophisticated a dish as the other dessert, but it hit in all the right places.

When we got back to the hotel, we took a look at Maypop online and were learned their flavor concept is a fusion of SOUTHERN---and---ASAIN; odd to process at first but looking over the menu and were were impressed enough to make a reservation for that night.

We ordered their ANNATTO SESAME ROLLS; served with Cultured Butter and Shellfish Pepper Jam... yes, I said Shellfish Pepper Jam and before you begin thinking fishy jelly, let me just clarify then Jam was delicious.

Right after delivered the Rolls, another server came by with a complimentary sample dish... I don''t recall exactly what they described but for the most part it was a "SAVORY" VERSION OF A BEIGNET (rich and moist and not sweet by any means) and it was served over a Remoulade (it was seasoned and almost like a Crab Remoulade). As delicious as the Beignet was, it was the remoulade that shined. We even asked our waitress to place a full order of these Savory Beignets BUT they don''t have them as a menu item (but I wish they did).

My son ordered the LOUISIANA BLACK DRUM OVER BUTTERNUT SQUASH PURÉE... I didn''t have to ask if he loved his dish; it was obvious.  The fish had the skin over but it was done with crisp skin but the rest of the fish was soft. 

I had a hard time choosing since so many dishes were interesting but I ended up going with the server''s suggestion, SPAGHETTI IN A COCONUT CRAB BROTH. Oh my, it was nothing like a broth... way too rich and thick (not watery). It also had Louisiana Blue Crab and Braised Leeks. Loved my dish.

The serving sizes are not huge so we "THOUGHT" we''d be able to get dessert but the food is VERY RICH and as much as we wanted to see what amazing things they can do with dessert, we were just done.

MAYPOP didn''t take no for an answer so for the second time during this dinner, they presented up with "another taste". 

This time it was a very small taste... very small as in the size of my thumbnail; no kidding. Again, I didn''t pay attention enough to know exactly what it was but I would say it was a CHOCOLATE TORTE with a hint of Caramel and a heavy dusting of Cocoa Powder and a touch of Rock Salt.

That said, the service was some of the worst and most offensive I''ve ever experienced. It directly impacted our experience of the food - which took forever to come out and then once the first two people of our seven person party were served it took almost ten minutes until the rest of the food came out. All that said - I get it. Stuff happens in a restaurant and me and the people I was dining with were totally patient with all this. Then a waitress spilt a tub of sour cream all over the shirts and costs of the people on one side of the table. We all worked really hard to maintain high spirits and tell the waitress it was alright before we realized she actually didn''t care. No apology or anything else was even said about it. No free drink offer, no comped dinner, nothing. At the conclusion of the meal, after we paid the full bill with the mandatory twenty percent tip, one woman in our party went to just let the manager know that we were disappointed with how they handled the situation. We all were aghast when the manager began to raise her voice and scream at our friend, telling her that it was "not their fault" that the sour cream fell. It was kind of a erratic and mildly unstable response that made us all uncomfortable. She proceeded to scream as we left the restaurant. Having heard the whole conversation, I truly don''t know what set her off. 

Again, the food was decent but when the place is managed by someone so manic, it''s hard to imagine that the customer service is going to make for a good experience, especially when the food is average at best.

Oh also, we ordered the salsa appetizer and the guac appetizer, both of which come with chips. However, for our table of seven they brought us ONE small basket of chips for the two appetizers. We had to ask for another and they brought it. Not a huge deal, but that was the kind of service they had even before the final ordeal.

THE FOOD
Everything we had was phenomenal! Grits, red beans & rice, iced latte, shrimp on grits, and even the mimosa was somehow better than the usual. And, oh my god, the french toast. It was so good, I didn''t even put butter, syrup, or anything on it. And pricing was so reasonable! I think they could charge more for the quality they''re delivering.

THE STAFF
Some of the kindest folks I''ve ever met. I had flown into NOLA with my 1 year old ahead of my husband because of a work thing. So, it was just us when we went in for brunch the first time. They immediately came to the table to help me set up a high chair and brought over some grits without even requesting. (If you''re a parent, you know getting food to the table quickly is the key to a peaceful meal.) She had her first ever grits and was a big fan. When it was time to leave, and I was visibly struggling with cleaning up and getting my little one to not jump out of the chair, the host insisted that I leave the mess (it wasn''t a ton but enough that I felt I should pick it up, not staff) and then bounced my daughter around while I gathered all our things. I don''t even think my family/friends are this helpful when out with my kid.

THE VIBE
Ya know, the structure itself isn''t anything to write home about - cute outside sitting space, a bit small inside - but it just had warm vibes due to the staff and owner. You could tell that good hearts work here and the ''everyone here is family'' vibe permeated the space.

FOR PARENTS:
Usually, I include a section in my review for parents commenting on space for strollers, changing tables, etc. I can''t remember if there''s a changing table, I know it was a tight squeeze inside with a stroller but I would still call this place ''family-friendly'' because of the staff. If you came in with a stroller that''s too big, they''re not giving you side eye - they''re welcoming you in and seeing if they can find a place for it to be stored while you sit and stay a while.

The pesto was tasty with a touch of cream in the sauce. The pasta could have been more al dente but ultimately I can never go wrong with pesto. Scattered roasted red pepper strips added some variety. 

I adored the veggie wrap with hummus, roasted red peppers, roasted eggplant, baby spinach, kalamata olives, and feta which with the sundried tomato mayo was decadent and creamy and paired perfectly surrounded by a soft and warm pita. GF for some reason wasn''t a fan which escapes my comprehension. I was way too stuffed to finish the whole thing which is a big regret for me.

We also had the tuna tartare appetizer.  There was an over abundance of large  gauge trout roe covering the very thin layer of tuna in the small bowl. I would''ve loved less roe and more tuna. The roe was just too gamey and overpowering. Disclaimer - I don''t like caviar, so it might be a "me" issue.

For my main I chose the yellowfin tuna.  Our server explained that it would be prepared rare, and wanted to be certain we were ok with that.

I think I have a million check ins here (OK I checked it''s only 64). When in doubt I stop by for tacos. 
Seriously this spot has fed most of my family in friends, from my Mom "who doesn''t like Mexican food" and now loves their rice bowls (both the superbowl and the MexiBowl) to the pickiest niece when she was a little who only wanted a single chicken taco with sour cream for dipping. 

For pandemic times, I''ve gotten take out a few times, including bringing big plates to my parents. Dad loves the plantains. 

You can call in an order or stop at the counter. They are doing curbside delivery if you ask. You can also get a sangria or margarita to go. 

I love that you can mix and match tacos based on your mood. The fish is flounder and delish. I also love a no meat taco with all the veggies, beans & rice. Plus the shrimp quesadilla is a fave.

There is no parking lot, but plenty of street and neighborhood parking nearby. It is easy to miss this spot, but it is not too big or too small. To start off, our server gave us chips and queso. I was shocked because most places only give complimentary chips and salsa! After studying the menu, my friend and I ordered their Empanadas, Spicy Chorizo Taco, Grilled Rib Eye Taco topped as a fish taco, Roasted Pork Taco, and Super Bowl. 

The food came out quickly and everything looked amazing. I loved the fry of the empanadas, they were perfectly fried with a great crisp! The inside tasted like a Cajun meat pie, which was very flavorful. It came with pico de gallo and sour cream to balance the dish out. The tacos were a bit pricey, but they load them up with plenty of meat and you can choose up to four toppings (including guac!). The tacos looked and tasted great; they will definitely fill you up! My friend and I loved the "topped like a fish taco" options for our tacos, which gave the tacos great flavor and crunch with spicy tartar sauce and red cabbage! The Super Bowl looked great and was basically a large deconstructed taco with tortilla on the side. Our server was very attentive, keeping our chips and queso filled up and waters topped off.

Overall, a great lunch option if you are in the mood for Latin and having a hard time choosing where to eat on Freret. The food is priced right and generously portioned! There are plenty of options to choose from and I cannot wait to try them all.', 867, 4, 115);

The last place that I liked a lot really got turnt out.

Fortunately this place was (out) of guacamole.
They were also out of their main special.

But they did have queso, that "I thought" was much too authentic.  For someone from Louisiana I can tell you it was "hot as hell". It ain''t Piccadilly cornbread.

Went with the shrimp  quesadilla and the fish tacos.

While staring around checked out the artwork.  It genuinely fit the establishment and the neighborhood "to a t". There was even a 3-D attempt of the Claiborne overpass, with protruding mini car and all.

While waiting for the food, we had that "wobbly table", and the nice waitress noticed it right away.  She was trying to fix a wobbly table on an uneven floor-boy.  That''s like placing somebody in a round room and telling them there is something in the corner.

Anyway, I was completely taken aback  with the food here.  They say "it''s better to under promise and over deliver".  My gosh.  The food was beyond expectation.  I cannot really express the experience really well except to say that there is a "hot & new" place in Metairie with an hour wait out the door.
 
The fish tacos  were made from fried flounder with cabbage and spicy aioli mayo and the shrimp on the quesadillas were huge.  As a matter of fact, when I got the bill, just tore it up, and told the waitress to start over just because it was so incredible.  Ordered the same exact thing- like Deja-vu or a bad dream.  And got the fish tacos with the shrimp quesadilla, again.

This time the waitress know I had overstepped a boundary, and it was really time to "clear this table".  It was like "oh, and by the way here is a mint-pineapple popsicle made by the chef". It was a like some new type of music .  This chef might not speak English, but they definitely know the international language of food.  This chef must be from Ensenada, Oaxaca, Monterrey, or someplace far away.  They are definitely the "ruin of many a good boy".  If anybody knows how the story of "billy the kidd", with his many travels across the border and back- this place definitely has some of those mysterious characteristics.  

So wrap all of that up with a unique place in a unique neighborhood that has unique food, and  bam.
I would really risk going to this place if it was in the middle of Syria . The whole time there are to-go orders that looked as if they do catering for half the city.  And there were enough people to easily handle the demand.  Least to say that Sarita''s has got it going on.  I guess "just look at the photos".  The chef came out with these lemonade/mint popsicles.  If they had a daiquiri or icee machine that made those I would be going through lots of ca$h here....!', 869, 5, 115);

It reminded me of a satsuma type of flavor, very enjoyable. 

The price is a bit expensive, but I''m not really surprised since it''s located on Magazine Street where most places will be pricy. One advice that I would give to Nomiya is that they should make their ramen bigger because it seemed pretty small for a bowl that''s almost $20.00. I honestly finished it quickly and wasn''t as full as I''d thought I be from a bowl of ramen. As for the service, they were sufficient and good to my friends and I. The decor was really Japanese street inspired, which was very trendy and aesthetic! I wish I had taken photos of the place, but I guess everyone can see it from other photos too.

Unfortunately, my friend and her stepdad did not enjoy their French toast. They''d been there before and had it; however, they were not pleased this time around. They said the French toast was overly cooked. Nonetheless, her mother enjoyed the white beans (special of the day) and they enjoyed the seafood fries.

Before Hurricane Katrina this location was a Creole Buffet spot I used to visit for weekly meetings I attended here then it has also been a Mexican restaurant and a BBQ restaurant.  Unfortunately this Friday December 1st, 2023 will be the last day that Seafood Sally''s will be open as they have announced they are closing the restaurant. 

I''m always sad to see places close like this although I have to say my one and only visit to this restaurant wasn''t the best experience as the service was definitely lacking and I found my dessert very tiny and very overpriced for what it was.  When I say the service was bad I couldn''t even get a refill on my iced tea... Looking at the menu I found the prices for most of the food here to be quite overpriced for the area and much of the seafood selection just didn''t appeal to me for the cost so I just got a cheeseburger and fries and then a chocolate tart for dessert.  The burger and fries were good and decently priced while my chocolate tart was a very small serving that didn''t measure up to the price attached to it.  Overall the fact I only visited one time and never felt compelled to return doesn''t really make me feel that bad that they are closing as I like this location and I hope something better moves in here.

INSERT INTO yelp.review VALUES (4883, 'Unfortunately, the food at Seafood Sally''s is a watered-down version of how a food item really should be. Is it catered to the population of people who are watching their sodium intake? A population of people who like only mild hints of flavors? Honestly, this restaurant served food that was edible, but I wouldn''t call it palatable. We left without ordering entrees because it was that bad.

Scrapin'' the Coast Fish Dip ($11) - This was the most lackluster fish dip I''ve ever tasted. It seemed as if the fish, scallions, and some veggies were tossed in a mayonnaise sauce with no seasoning. Also, because it''s served with saltines, you can''t expect the crackers to give it a flavorful boost either. Another point, why saltines though? For $11, you would think we could get a yummier cracker...

Red Beans and Rice ($6) - The portion was expected for the price and the uptown location. However, again, where was the flavor? It was the most bland red beans and rice I''ve had in New Orleans. There is nothing in there to give it any flavor. Just plain beans with a dry mouthfeel. I love red beans cooked with some bacon/sausage/etc. to give it that robust zing, but it''s not required. I''ve had vegetarian red beans with plenty of flavor too. This is not the place to get your red beans whether you eat meat or not.

Black Pepper Fried Chicken Wings ($12) - Paying $12 for 3 wings and 3 small drumsticks was a ripoff. Never again. I would have excused it if it was at least delicious. It was NOT. The breading had zero flavor, where did the peppers come in? There was a runny sweet sauce pooled at the bottom of the bowl, which helped with the flavor, but there was no black pepper in there either. The sweet sauce tasted like a diluted duck-sauce. It was garnished with mint leaves and scallions, but that was purely for aesthetics. It''s like they''ve never heard of flavor before.

As I mentioned before, we decided against ordering entrées given how bad the appetizers were. This doesn''t happen to us very often and I don''t often give such bad reviews. (Check my review history if you doubt me!)

Firstly, our server Ian was incredible!! He was so lively, and clearly just loves hospitality and recommending the best dishes & drinks on the menu! 

Secondly, the drinks!! My boyfriend got the Berried Treasure, and I got the Girls just wanna have sun. My boyfriend is not a big drinker and he said he could''ve crushed the berried treasure all day long. The girls just wanna have sun was also fantastic, so refreshing to combat the smokiness of a mezcal tequila base. However I love Mezcal, so I truly thought it was a fantastic cocktail. 

Thirdly & definitely not the last; the food was OUT OF THIS WORLD. We love crab and theirs were fantastic. Also the gumbo with crab and sausage was phenomenal. Then we got a boil of the blue crabs with the corn. It was spicy enough to just make your lips tingle a little, and so fresh! We then got the Louie lips and that shit was out of this world. Again my boyfriend is from Maryland and he agreed the Louie lips was so flavorful; it was such a different sauce base and so finger lickin good. We then just loved the place so much and the drinks we got a side of fries to finish with their garlic mayo and that was the perfect ending to our meal.

One of the worst dips ever tried in my life, you can go to any local grocery in New Orleans and get a dip 10x better than that.

Red beans and rice was ok, nothing spectacular but it wasn''t nearly as bad as the other two items.

Ambiance was very cute. Perfect for a date or a brunch with friends.

Food:
Cinnamon Roll - great cinnamon roll. We got it to split (which was a good decision since it was large and we got plenty of other food).

Fried Chicken Biscuit - this was an open face biscuit with chicken on top, with a sunny side egg on top of that. Overall really good, would definitely get again.

Debris Hash Skillet - this was homemade tater tots, with a roast beef and some fried onions on top of that. While it was good, since my mother in law makes a good crockpot roast, I probably would not get again.

Bacon - just straight forward bacon. They asked if we liked crispy or chewy bacon which I thought was thoughtful / kind of funny.

Drinks:
Hibiscus Margarita - 10/10 get this if you like a marg. We both agreed this was great.

Frozen Lillet - 0/10 definitely would pass on this. We thought it was overpowering with its flowery aftertaste.

First reason for 2 stars: The sandwiches were pretty good. They were pretty sloppy, but in a good way! The bread was a little tough, but the meat was good. If it wasn''t for the sandwiches this would be a 1 star review for sure. 

Second reason for 2 stars: During the course of my time here (roughly 30 minutes from walking in to walking out), we saw a rat run across the floor and several roaches crawling on the walls. As I was talking to my friend a pretty plump roach crawled across the wall behind him. Yikes, Pretty distracting. 

There was also a real funky smell about the place that also made it tough to enjoy the food. Actually, that''s understating quite a bit. It smelled like a worn area of Bourbon Street very late into the night. No bueno.

The chef here has cooked in some of the best kitchens here in NOLA and elsewhere. He masterfully crafts incredible food through several courses that are delicious and mind-blowing.

 I could talk about each dish one by one, but this night was about something else. Funny thing about food, it is about so much more than calories and taste. Don''t get me wrong, I eat because I am food obsessed, and the flavors are super important to me. Food is about people, history, culture, tradition, location, and even climate. People bring not only their food staples with them when they move (OR are moved) to far flung regions, their culture comes too, as does their history. Take okra for example. It most likely originated in West Africa and was called gombo. It was brought over to America by slaves, as was the other vital part of the dish, rice. Many of the slaves were brought to America through the ports of New Orleans. Here it became the centerpiece of the food we know as gumbo.

Serigne Mbaye, you just fed this white guy with the very same (or similar) food that Africans ate as they last laid eyes on their home continent and land, and were to be sold? You humbled me......you made me understand through food how no other human being ever has. You have a gift! I commented to you tonight to never stop giving a talk during the meal like you delivered at  tonight''s. Wow! I who have lived in this country of my birth have never understood the plight of those misplaced, taken, or forced from their homelands. I who don''t really belong here (in the new world), understood through food this idea, this emotion, this feeling of being misplaced. Being where you should not be. Native Americans belong here in America not Europeans. What the hell.........food? It transcends everything and brings understanding to those still without it, and sight to those like me who are blind. Gut punch.

I happen to think that Dakar is an essential dining location for everyone. The food is unbelievable but there is a story to be told here too. Maybe one person in a hundred people will get out of it what I did this very night. I hope for far more though, I truly do. Go with an empty stomach, and an open mind. See what happens!

He came out after the bread ''n'' butter and before the courses to speak at length. This is something I wish all restaurants did (although yes, I realize that''s totally impractical, but even if it were text-based it would be neat!)

His explanation of the first course, ''The Last Meal'' completely changed the way I experienced it. It would have probably been my favorite course anyway, but picturing it within its historical context, awful as it was, added several layers to the crabmeat, palm oil, and black-eyed peas that would end up being my favorite course.

A close second was the penultimate course, the tamarind fish, a beautiful cut of red snapper festooned with squashes, herbs, greens, and dabs of sauce.

Everyone at my table loved the ''Parce Que'', a circle of huge gulf shrimp in a brick red sauce. I wasn''t as wild about it.

Food:
I did enjoy almost all the dishes we ordered. We ordered:
The crab and persimmons - I thought this was delicious and flavor forward. The persimmons and greens were lovely and it was chalk full of crab. I loved the sauce, which definitely had a kick, but my friend thought it was too salty. At $18, I thought this dish was excellent and really reasonably priced.
Turnips in a citrus miso sauce - by far the worst dish of the night. After such a flavor forward dish with the crab, these were so bland, we were both incredibly disappointed. It was also surprising because when is miso ever bland? My friend had to eventually ask for some salt. 
The cornbread - really, really good. It comes in a honey sauce that is delicious. At only $3.50, don''t skip this.
The yardbird chicken dish - this was an really interesting, delicious mix of flavors and textures. The sauce it was cooked in was great as was the side sauce it came with. It also came with collard green leaves to wrap it in and a bunch of fresh herbs and greens that complimented the chicken well. My problem with this dish is the price. At $41, it was the most expensive thing on the menu and although we really enjoyed it, we just don''t get why half a (not large) chicken costs that much. I don''t think I''d pay that much for it again.
The satsuma upside down cake - this cake was superb. A little denser cake than you might be expecting, the texture is smooth and the cake is moist and delicious. The satsumas were delightfully sweet with some tartness that you should expect from citrus. I would come back to eat that cake every night.

Drinks:
Yardbird - Delicious and very lemon forward.
Vodka tonic - my friend just wanted a classic cocktail. She ordered a vodka tonic with three limes. Instead her guess is that she got a vodka club soda with three limes, which she hated. When the bill came, they charged us $9 for the vodka (fine) and $2 for the tonic. What a weird way to bill for a drink, especially because the drink did not have tonic in it. Just charge us $11 dollars for the drink in total. 
Polyamory cocktail - My friend liked this, but I thought the shrub made it too vinegar forward and couldn''t finish it.

Service:
The service was probably the low point of the night. There wasn''t anything horrible about it, but when you pay over $150 for your meal, the service should be above average. For example, the yardbird chicken special: we are both fairly certain that the description did not specify that it was meant to be chicken wraps. And the dish came with no explanation other than the server mumbling "here are you chicken wraps" as she dropped them off and walked away. My friend never even heard the server say it at all. The collard green leaves were sort of hidden under all the other herbs, so it was not obvious that they should be the wraps. If I hadn''t thought I heard them say it, we would have been eating these undressed greens separately from the chicken, missing out on the great combination of flavors and textures.

Standouts for us were the shaved country ham app - southern US prosciutto dressed with pickled local strawberries, lemongrass chili and fresh mint.

Our reservation was for 8:30pm. When we arrived, our tables were occupied. The place was packed overall. We had maybe a 30 minute wait in the hot, humid night -- it was not unbearable, thank goodness, since it was already late September. The waiters, with a bit of a nudge, did something smart. They brought out menus and took drink orders.  Everyone who came out, and it must have been five parties including an actual birthday party, was happy and recommended the place. One lady who identified herself as from Beverly Hills wondered if we were paparazzi, which she said sometimes followed her, making us speculate over whether she was famous though we didn''t recognize her, or if she was joking. 

I organized our table. We ordered seven appetizers for nine people and five desserts. That allowed us to sample. (I ended up in a leadership role on the basis of planning for dinner parties. The other standard operating procedure is having everyone introduce themselves with a story with a choice of multiple prompts -- you have to offer a prompt, but it is best to have a multiple options.) Everything was excellent and consumed to the last morsel. That included the potato gnocchi, chicken liver pate, deviled eggs, calamari, cauliflower, and two specials. I can report on only my own main course, the gumbo, which was dark and smoky. Nobody complained. It was festive. We were all starving by the time we sat down. Even considering that factor, the quality of the food here was at the highest level, and that is in a city which is all about dining out. The one note, and this applies to literally every single meal I have had in New Orleans, is you could not eat like this every night. Or, more accurately, you should not do so. This was not at the very far end of the scale of richness -- which is good -- but it could not be described as a health conscious experience. That is the deal. Nobody comes to this town thinking, you know, I''m going to do well with my diet plan while I''m here.

My observation is this establishment is suited to a group. I am not sure it would be great for a couple on a third date who wanted a quiet spot. That is a description and not a criticism. To reiterate: this was fun of the first order.', 958, 5, 127);

Let''s start with the good! OMG their falafel was AMAZING. I would come by just to get some falafels. They were crispy and very well-seasoned. The interior was soft and green. I''m not sure what the green was from, but I''m guessing fresh herbs. These were the best and most flavor-packed falafels I''ve had in the city!! At $6 for 6, it''s not that pricey either.

I also had the beef shish kabob plate ($18). It comes with a side of salad and hummus. The portions were generous, no complaints there! They give you plenty of meat too; no skimping! The beef was flavorful, tender, and just delicious! The hummus that comes with it was creamy and good with a little 1drizzle of garlic olive oil. The salad was fresh, but the dressing was lackluster. It was flavorless and seemed like just oil.

I got a side of basmati rice ($3), which was mediocre. The portion was kind of small (rice is so cheap, why are we skimping here?), but it was cooked well. However, it was yellow with zero flavor to go with the color. Most other Mediterranean places season their rice with stock and etc., so it''s yum to eat by itself. Not this place. I guess I shouldn''t have assumed or expected too much.

We substituted a side with the baba ganuj to try it too. It was okay, but kind of bland. It needs more seasoning.

The vegetarian stuffed grape leaves ($6.50) were awful. It was bland, flavorless, falling apart, not fresh, and just not worth the calories. Stuffed grape leaves should taste great on their own without being smothered in sauce. Plus, they tried to cover up the ones that were falling apart with garnish. Come on, guys... These were the worst I''ve had in New Orleans.

I probably wouldn''t go to Lebanon''s Cafe again, but it was fine. Maybe if you live in the area and you don''t have a car or something. It''s just that there are so many other fantastic Mediterranean restaurants in our town for the same (or cheaper) price.', 1011, 2, 135);

We were a party of four, and all were happy with our food. Entrees were reasonably sized and shareable if you have some appetizers. The biryani was really delicious and a large portion.

Service/Staff: The staff was incredible.  At some point it felt as if everyone on the clock stopped by my table.  Whether it was to clear my table, bring the next dish or just ask how I felt about the meal. Everyone seemed to take pride in the job and they gave the impression they really enjoyed working here.  One waiter came over and asked if I planned on ordering the tasting menu for just myself or just decided once I saw the menu.  I told him I couldn''t decide and wanted to try as much as possible. He told me the chef looked out and saw it was just me and was very impressed haha.  Another waitress proudly asked, "Did you hear?! New York Times named us one of the top 25 restaurants in New Orleans!".  The chef also came to my table and we talked for a bit. He said he also goes out by himself all the time and orders a big portion of the menu.  I definitely felt like a V.I P. from the attentiveness of the staff. Top tier experience.  

THE FOOD: Now I was on a solo mission. I knew I wanted something good but I really didn''t know how to choose so I got the tasting menu (6 courses but I was gifted a 7th traditional Indian treat). The cool thing about the tasting menu is it''s collaborative.  You can say what you do/don''t want on the tasting menu.  I picked the gumbo and the oysters.

Everything was delicious! But I will speak on a few of the dishes.  First up, THE CURRIED SEAFOOD GUMBO. Listen. I typically avoid ordering gumbo at restaurants. People that visit will all ask my top gumbo recommendation & I never have one.  My favorites come from Ms. Dedra and Chef Toya.  I only have access to that gumbo because that''s family. Now I can confidently recommend THIS gumbo. In fact, at one point I was standing outside the bathroom and a lady asked me about the gumbo and I recommended it. Second, THE OYSTER BED, just get it!

INSERT INTO yelp.review VALUES (5016, 'Finally got to have dinner here! I remember when Saffron opened up over 10 years ago on the West Bank, a much more humble operation, and the buzz surrounding it. Once it opened on Magazine, it was next to impossible to get a reservation and it sounded like it was worth the hype. I love the idea of a place growing and gaining such a following. And it seems like they truly deserve it.

The most impressive thing that I couldn''t help but notice was how tight of an operation it is. They have a very dedicated team working both front and back of house and they are dedicated to providing a phenomenal experience for their guests. 

Saffron is not a traditional Indian restaurant. It''s upscale/trendy and has a gorgeous modern atmosphere. Classy! The cocktail and wine list is impressive and I had a sumptuous passion fruit cocktail called Vanilla Handcuffs. It comes with a prosecco sidecar to cleanse the palate. Have you ever? This is not a vanilla vodka-forward cocktail at all, but involves actual vanilla bean. It''s literally exquisite.

That said, their lack of vegan options is a big disappointment because for decades, I''ve always counted on a vibrant selection at an Indian restaurant. When I asked about vegan options, our waiter seemed to think that several items would work, including the daal, however there are some items, like the daal, that have recipes that cannot be altered. I''ll get to that in a minute.

We started with the Aloo Tiffin Chaat which can be veganized if you ask them not to bring the spiced yogurt sauce. This is so unique and tasty, and the presentation utterly lovely, as a different server put it together at the table, lovingly describing each sauce poured over the potato cake. We shared it but it could easily be an entree. Honestly not sure, though, that it is so spectacular that I''d order it again at that seemingly high price point ($25). 

We also shared the pickles, vegan if you get roti rather than naan (which is rarely vegan at traditional Indian restaurants, by the way) to accompany it. This is another dish I felt was at a pretty high price point ($14) for a tiny bowl of pickles. The roti is brought cold and is not anything to write home about. Not sure about it accompanying the pickles. I''d pass (might be better if you can have the naan?)

We waited a pretty long time for our entrees to come out. The waiter came over and explained a mix-up in the kitchen. No big deal, my friend and I were catching up and were in no rush. 

What was less than desirable was that I had ordered a side of potatoes and the aforementioned daal and only the potatoes came out with the food when it all arrived roughly 20 minutes later, because the kitchen informed the waiter that the daal wasn''t vegan. Shouldn''t he know this? So I ordered the Wok Gobi (cauliflower) and waited. I wanted to eat the potatoes with the entree (their rice has chicken stock, which I''m sorry, is extremely annoying when you consider so many people count on Indian restaurants to have vegetarian options. Can''t they have a plain rice option?) so they were in fact cold by the time the cauliflower (delicious, so delicious) came out. While the potatoes had some nice spice going on, they needed salt. 

Here''s my issue: I 100% appreciate the kitchen being aware of what vegan means and wish servers in this day and age took the initiative to learn what dietary restrictions mean. My experience was less than ideal, cold potatoes (unless I just wanted to eat them first which is weird) and cauliflower. 

I hate ending the review like this, when otherwise service as a whole is extremely impressive from host to bartenders and waitstaff. But this really pricey dinner was underwhelming and I''m doubtful I''d return for a meal when at the same price point, I could eat at Shaya or Saba (both of which are Israeli and not Indian but they are my favorite upscale restaurants on Magazine) where I have a lot more options.

I would return and have another Vanilla Handcuffs at the bar, though. I appreciate the atmosphere (and if that cocktail is an indicator of the other ones on the menu, I need to try more).', 1021, 3, 136);

I recently embarked on a culinary journey at Apolline, enticed by their COOLinary Dinner Menu. My experience was nothing short of a rollercoaster ride, with flavors that ranged from lackluster to phenomenal. Allow me to walk you through the highs and lows of my visit.

The ambiance at Apolline is undeniably charming. The presence of real roses on every table, each nestled within an elegant glass bottle, immediately sets a romantic and refined tone. The attention to detail in maintaining the restaurant''s aesthetic is commendable, and it''s evident that the staff take pride in creating a delightful dining atmosphere. Although there was a minor hiccup in initially being served, the service eventually shone through, thanks to our server, Jonathan. He expertly guided us through the dining experience, presenting us with delectable dinner rolls and providing comprehensive insights into the menu. His assistance in navigating substitutions when certain items were unavailable demonstrated his dedication to ensuring our satisfaction. The host''s gentlemanly demeanor and playful sense of humor further enriched the overall atmosphere.

The Fried Green Tomatoes left me less than impressed. The dish was let down by its cold toppings, especially the shrimp, which hindered the tomatoes'' texture. An earnest request led to its removal from my plate, as I was unable to fully appreciate its potential.

However, the Arugula Salad made up for it. A blend of flavors, the inclusion of green apple pieces, pecans, goat cheese, and balsamic reduction elevated this dish to new heights. The freshness of the ingredients was unmistakable, with the apple pieces acting as the proverbial cherry on top. The fact that my date was reluctant to share even half of his portion spoke volumes about the salad''s excellence. And also about his charm, cause would I have given my date half of my app? I''m not sure. 

The entrée journey continued with a twist - the unavailability of Gulf Fish prompted a substitution with Salmon. Unfortunately, the Salmon failed to leave a lasting impression, with an underwhelming flavor profile that lacked the desired depth. It was a reminder that even a perfectly seared top couldn''t compensate for an absence of thoughtful seasoning.

The Grilled Lamb- it was an experience! Cooked to a perfect medium, this plate showcased everything my Gulf Fish was supposed to. Accompanied by yellow rice, spinach, and a spicy tomato chutney, the lamb delivered an exceptional taste experience. The impeccable sear and browning on the top layer were a testament to the chef''s skill, making it a standout moment of the meal.

As the final curtain fell, the dessert segment brought a mix of emotions. The Flourless Chocolate Cake, while disappointingly dense and devoid of the truffle-like richness expected from a flourless creation, was counterbalanced by its accompaniments - crème anglaise, macerated berries, and powdered sugar.

On the other hand, the Italian Ice (albeit mislabeled as a Seasonal Sorbet) rekindled our taste buds with its vibrant Kiwi Strawberry flavor. Fresh fruit toppings further enriched the experience, showcasing that even a misleading name couldn''t obscure its delectable attributes.

We felt that the food quality and flavor along with the salsa and chips (we didn''t have to pay extra for extra salsa) [Big plus].

The walls were lined with posters stating their standing in the TexMex/Mexican standings throughout NOLA. We truly understand the love of their food as we were impressed with the quality and flavor of our meals.

We highly suggest Juan''s Flying Burritos over Johnny Sanchez (there is a location around the corner from Johnny Sanchez (515 Baronne St, New Orleans, LA 70113) which we felt was superiorly inefficient in quality and price related to Juan''s flying Tacos.

So, save yourself disappointment in the NOLA TexMex/Mexican food genre by bypassing Johnny Sanchez and heading straight to Juan''s Flying Burritos.

Remember, I am not a paid endorser and neither establishment is unable to sway me with free meals as we reside in Michigan and no meal anywhere is able to convince me to spend money on airfare to try their food.

The quality of the food here had slipped a bit before Katrina and then it slipped a lot after and they were running on only 2 or 3 cylinders for awhile.  Well now they are roaring along on all 8 cylinders, like a fine tuned race car, and the food is once again fantastic!  They have also FINALLY started taking credit cards which wasn''t an option before Katrina.  They only thing that remains to be a great inconvenience here is the sheer popularity of the place, as there is often a long wait to get inside, but that is just further proof of how amazing this place is.  The one thing that would make this place even more fantastic would be the addition of an oyster bar as the lack of raw oysters is a significantly felt and glaring omission in a place such as this.

For the portion sizes you get here it is extremely hard to beat the fantastic value that this place typically offers but inflation is certainly hurting the value options at many restaurants these days.  If you want to experience the epitome of traditional "everyday" New Orleans food this is probably the single best place to look into its soul.  Mandina''s is what a lot of places in New Orleans used to be and it''s the "it" that many places are still trying to recapture.  Sure there are all sorts of new places and innovative "new" spins on food but when it comes to my dining raison d''être of NOLA food my orbit will always be drawn to circle the bright sun of the traditional dishes here.

Overall they just seem to keep getting better and better here and the only items I''ve not been very impressed with from my recent meals is the burger could use a lot of improvement and the Old Fashioned could use some better quality cherries.

I do feel like both the fish and shrimp themselves were a little bland and not quite seasoned to my liking, but I always get my poboys dressed so all of the flavors together were just fine and gave me what I needed to satisfy my craving.

It was mid-day and we had the good fortune of chatting with some regulars and getting great recommendations that we might not have tried otherwise.
The fried chicken is seriously good.
The mustard greens and red beans and rice, are also excellent.
The shrimp Po-Boy was one of the favorites of our week-long trip to New Orleans.
One of our group praised the Gumbo as well.
We also ordered a collection of sides at the recommendation of the regulars we ran into.
The hashbrowns were perfect. And a couple of us are from the East Coast, where we take hashbrowns very seriously. 
Their cornbread dressing was a perfect side for the fried chicken.
And the surprise side winner was the Carrot Souffle.
Sweet and airy while still retaining its root vegetable character, it was fantastic and a hit with all five of us.
On top of all that, we shared around an order of the Homemade Bread Pudding.
We all needed naps after that meal.
The atmosphere at Neyow''s is great. The food was exceptional. And the service was just right.

We even went back several days later for a more typical dinner.

I. Service is great.  This is a southern thing, so if you''re expecting white glove, 5-star service then this won''t exist nearly anywhere in the NOLA.  If you are, however, simply wanting quick, courteous service then you''re going to be satisfied.

2.  The tacos.  We had the jerk chicken, duck duck goose, chile glazed shrimp, and calypso beef.  The side we chose was the coconut mango rice.  

Jerk chicken had great flavor without being too spicy.  I love spice, but my wife tends to curse a few times when it''s too spicy.  She only showed smiles and an impressive glance at her plate.  The duck duck goose was very tender and flavorful.  The shrimp and beef were equally delicious.  The rice did not have coconut shreds in it.

We had the Rum Punch.  I came during happy hour and wish I could share reviews for more drinks.  I can''t.  I stuck with the Rum Punch.

I quit on the spot around the time the staff began setting up for a Friday "Gappy Hour (Gay/Happy)" as they called it. Jason began to put a sign that had dress code "dont''s".

I proceeded to ask why the sign and verbatim Jason said, "The blacks are scarring the locals." 
I said, well I''m black and I work here and he responds, "Don''t worry, your''e a good one." 
I told him that in some cultures nice Jordan''s are equivalent to a suit and tie and how my parents are well off, so what if they showed up in nice attire, nice Jordan''s and in their nice car and he respond''s, and this is burned in my memory, "Black people buy nice things to cover up the pain from inside."

I opted for the brothless delight, featuring blackened chicken, spinach, Union kimchi, a poached egg, nori flakes, cilantro, and ramen noodles. A twist of fate led to a poultry-based broth and a hard-boiled egg instead, but oh, what a delightful deviation! The broth was comprised of light flavors, perfectly complementing the lovely and seasoned blackened chicken. The spinach, a verdant addition, elevated the dish. The noodles, albeit a tad firmer than my usual preference, played their part in crafting a truly yummy meal.

Next in line was my friend''s selection - the Original Tori Ramen. This bowl featured a chicken-based broth, embellished with in-house roasted pork, bamboo shoots, scallions, seasoned egg, fried garlic, and ramen noodles. Although we were used to the softer texture of Mama Noodles, every component performed a delightful dance on our taste buds, orchestrating a harmonious blend of flavors that left us grinning with satisfaction.

The firmer noodles were a minor note in the epicurean masterpiece that was conducted by Union Ramen.

Lamb korma - very tiny serving. Not worth the price. The lamb meat was soft but possibly 6 pieces in the curry. The actual curry was terrible.  It was definitely not a vindaloo at all. I''ve had so many vindaloos in my lifetime and this was not great at all. I do not think I will ever order this again

La Macarena is located in the New Orleans Riverbend Neighborhood and offers some pretty distinctive fare to what you will find in most of the other Latin American cuisine options inside the city limits. This restaurant originally opened back in 2003 and was located in the suburb of Kenner before relocating to their current location in 2008. This restaurant has now become noted for their pupusas and offering vegan and vegetarian options of their Latin American food specialties. La Macarena has a nice selection on their menus with enough items to please nearly any taste as long as it involves El Salvadorian style Latin American food. Many people consider this one of the best Latin American restaurant options in the New Orleans area and you certainly can get some very different food experiences here than at most other options in Orleans Parish.  Overall the unique selections here make for an interesting change of pace while this food does tend to be more on the bland side which isn''t what many folks in New Orleans tend to find to their liking.  This is definitely a spot that caters to vegetarians and Vegans so they seem to stay pretty busy with that crowd.

Also had fast and nice server, she answered all our questions, but our food did take too long for our liking, even our guac and chips took forever.

INSERT INTO yelp.review VALUES (5181, 'This was a cozy little shop off a popular street for eateries. Apparently known for their pupusas, that''s what I decided to try for lunch! A pupusa is basically a soft corn tortilla with a filling inside. They sandwich the fillings with the corn flour tortilla dough and then cook it on a pan. Kind of like a pancake!

I got the Pupusa Platter ($20), which comes with your choice of 3 pupusas. They have a variety of choices for fillings, but the three I chose were:

*Chicharron and cheese (a type of pork filling)
*Shrimp and cheese
*Pork, cheese, and beans (this is what they call the ''traditional'')

It comes with pickles and a tomato sauce. Most people choose to put them both as toppings for their pupusas to give it some extra zest! The pupusas themselves were flavorful and yummy with well-seasoned fillings, but I wished there was more. It''s about the size of your palm, but it''s not like a hand pie that has a lot of fillings. It''s like a VERY thin pancake, so the portion is small. 

The platter also comes with 2 slices of fried plantains with a yogurt sauce for dipping. I didn''t love the yogurt sauce, but you can''t go wrong with fried plantains! However, again, the portion is tiny. It''s 2 slices of plantains about the size of your thumb each. So, less than a quarter of a whole plantain. Plantains are so cheap... Why skimp so much? 

The pupusa platter also features a side of beans and salad. The beans tasted fine, nothing unexpected or particularly impressive, but again with the portion... It was served in a shallow tiny dish containing half the volume of a custard cup.

The salad was just sad. The most miniscule amount of lettuce, HALF A CHERRY TOMATO and a few slices of cucumber. Can that even be called a salad? The portion was equivalent to a garnish to decorate the plate.

For a $20 plate? That''s all I get? I thought it was outrageous.

Another thing that rubbed me the wrong way was that they create so much unnecessary waste. The drinks you order will come in a red plastic solo cup (the beer pong kind you use at college parties), and they only offer bottled water, for which they charge you $2 each. However, their passion fruit limeade ($4.50) was delicious! Super fruity and sweet, I have no complaints about that!

One thing to keep in mind is that this restaurant is a cash only place. It IS written on the wall, but I missed it because it looks like colorful decor and I wasn''t paying attention. My own fault, really, but I would have been in trouble if the person I was with also didn''t have cash on them.

Overall, the food was good! Taste wise, it was really decent, but the amount was so ridiculous to me. I came for lunch and spent over $25 for a snack and left hungry.

The staff were not only professional but also genuinely warm and welcoming, making us feel like valued guests. It''s no wonder why Pascal''s Manale has achieved its reputation as a local institution.

Now, let''s talk about the food. To start, we ordered the homemade mozzarella sticks and fried calamari. The mozzarella sticks were a revelation - oozing with creamy, molten cheese and encased in a perfectly crispy exterior. The calamari was tender, lightly battered, and served with a delightful marinara sauce, a testament to their dedication to quality and taste.

For our main course, we opted for the stuffed shrimp and the crab meat and scallop pasta. The stuffed shrimp were plump and succulent, generously filled with a delectable seafood stuffing that was bursting with flavor. It''s a dish that showcases the expertise of Pascal''s Manale''s kitchen. As for the crab meat and scallop pasta, it was a masterpiece of culinary art. The pasta was cooked to perfection, and the delicate sweetness of the crab meat and scallops harmonized wonderfully with the rich, creamy sauce.

What sets Pascal''s Manale apart is its commitment to preserving the tradition of New Orleans cuisine. The recipes here are passed down through generations, and you can taste the heritage and history in every bite. This dedication to authenticity is what makes it a culinary institution in the heart of New Orleans.

They have a great turtle soup and gumbo and finally they have brought back their lunch specials.  During lunch they have a BBQ shrimp po boy (for the cry babies that can''t handle peeling their own shrimp) but you can''t get that at night so get ready to peel and enjoy the messy ecstasy with your cute little bib if you decide to dine at night (as that is part of the joy)!  

I''ve had nearly everything on the menu and I''ve enjoyed it all.  One of the great things about this place is that it still seems to largely be off the tourists radar and almost always easy to get in without reservations.  This is a great place to have a really nice lunch in a classic New Orleans setting or an enjoyable dinner with friends.

It''s a small menu but has a surprising diversity of dishes, and a couple of vegan options (but most dishes have bacon, cheese, or meat).   The OG bowl looks good, probably will try that next time. 

Special shout-out to guy seating patrons and running the register that was adjacent to my perch in the single seat bar.  He was friendly in the extreme, helpful, and actually fun to watch work.  

Coffee is French Truck and 3 bucks, and they come around with refills.  Delicious and hot as French Truck oughta be, but I almost skipped going in because another review quoted coffee at $5.  I was relieved to find that posting was wrong.  I''m just too old and curmudgeonly to pay five dollars for cup of black hot coffee, especially when that buys me about a week of pots from Costco. 

Speaking of pots....I recently learned that I was as naïve about the term "wake and bake" as the late Loretta Lynn was with slang that almost cost WCBL their FCC license in 1960.   For years, I would see the name "Wakin'' Bakin''" and conjure up visions of bakers in toques working from before sunrise to bring their customers fresh bread and pastry.   Nope.  Thanks to my wife and walking urban dictionary, TIL that "wakin'' and bakin''" has to do with morning pot, and not the coffee brewing kind.  Oops.', 1265, 5, 167);

I really wasn''t sure to whom I was to address my requests, and the second person to my table spoke Spanish (no English) so I had to ask with pointing and didn''t get the response I wanted.

Had the salt and pepper pork lunch with fried rice. Made the choice based on pictures on the menu and no description - hated that, especially since I couldn''t get anyone to return to the table to explain to me how it was prepared and describe the other choices I was considering.

Did not realize pork was fried (again - no description) and ran into a lot of bones and fat. Didn''t finish my meal and took leftovers, but ended up throwing them out.

I''ll continue to find my "Happy Asian Food Place," because this wasn''t it.', 1317, 3, 174);

- FALAFEL (6 pieces): The falafel were crispy and still tasted fresh and not too dry/dense, with a mild kick from the spices
- GRILLED SALAD ($11.99): Green salad topped with gyro. The salad was simple and fresh, and the gyro was tender and less greasy than other I''ve had
- HALF AND HALF SHAWARMA ($15.99): A plate with our choice of chicken and beef shawarma, as well as default sides of hummus and salad
- OLIVE COMBINATION KABAB ($19.99): This came with kufta, chicken kabab, beef kabab. The beef kabab was perhaps slightly dry but went well with the hummus and rice (which we swapped out the salad for)
- GRILLED CATFISH PLATE ($14.99): Catfish covered in grilled veggies (carrots, squash, zucchini, onion). We got this one with hummus and baba ganuj

The food also came with a generous basket of pita bread. It was the thin kind and nothing super special on its own, but a great vehicle for soaking up the dips and sauces and making mini wraps.

The falafel sandwich is crispy goodness, the hummus is smooth and perfectly seasoned, the lentil soup is tasty, and the zatar bread boasts a delightful blend of spices.

- Fried egg, pork belly & avocado Banh Mi - solid
