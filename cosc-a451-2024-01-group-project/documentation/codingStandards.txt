            etc...

            // Purpose:
            to add stuff to a otherwise blank file because it looked lonely just sitting there

            Heres a template to copy and paste into a file:
            // Author:
            // Date Created:
            // Editors:
            // Date Last Edited:
            // Purpose:

    Comments
        - Write descriptive comments to add clarity
            (the goal is to improve readability among peers)
        - Comment above each function to briefly explain its:
            - purpose
            - inputs
            - outputs
            - and any side effects

    Commit Messages
        - Commit messages should be clear and informative to the best of your ability

    Changelog
        - At the bottom of each file, include a changelog that details significant changes,
          the reasoning behind them, and any additional context that could be helpful for other people
          who may edit the file.
          (the idea is similar to that of patchnotes for games)
        - Here is an example entry:
            /*
            Changelog:

            [3/29/2024] - [Sebastian Janikowski]
            - Change: [A description of the change(s)]
            - Reason: [The reason for making the change(s)]
            - Additional Notes: [Any additional information or context regarding the change
              that could be helpful or useful]
            */
        - The idea is to write over each entry for every new commit of the file.
          In other words, there should be a long list of changelogs. Only the one section as
          Git tracks version history.
        - The goal of this is to have a more detailed 'commit' message that can be referenced easily.
          It complements the version control history by providing insights into the 'why' behind changes,
          which is not always evident from diffs alone.
        - Keep in mind that the changelog is NOT a substitute for good commit messages. The file-specific
          changelog is an extra layer of documentation for clarity within the codebase itself.
        - If the change is related to a Git issue, please put that within the reason for the change. Like so:
            /*
                Changelog:

                [3/29/2024] - [Sebastian Janikowski]
                - Change: [A description of the change]
                - Reason: [Resolved Git issue #42]
                - Additional Notes: [Any additional information or context regarding the change
                that could be helpful or useful]
            */
