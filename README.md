# Project Name: NolaBytes

This project is a web platform similar to Yelp, focused on local restaurants in the New Orleans area. It allows users to search for, review, and discover restaurants. The development includes front-end, back-end, and middleware from scratch, with a strong emphasis on Java Servlets for the back-end to meet the educational objectives of understanding lower-level programming constructs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

`Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:`
- Java JDK 17 for backend development with Java Servlets
- Docker for containerization
- Intellij for running QA tests using junit
- DataGrip to see and for database management

#### Setting up Frontend

1. Ensure you have a basic setup for HTML and CSS.
2. Our front-end design is developed using Figma. To view the latest UI/UX designs, please visit the following link:

 - Please ensure you have appropriate access rights to view the design on Figma.
#### Setting up the Backend

2. Please `follow the steps below` if any installations for the above are needed.

### PostgreSQL
- Since PostgreSQL is run through a docker container there is no need to install it locally
### Installing DataGrip:
1. To avoid paying to use Datagrip please apply for the [JetBrains Student License](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students) `which is free`.
 - `For those who have not taken A270` you will need to do this anyway so might as well do it now.
2. Use the appropriate link for your device
 - [DataGrip for MacOS](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/download/#section=mac)
    - there are 2 .dmg files, one for `Apple Silicon` one for `intel`
 - [DataGrip for Windows](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/download/#section=windows)
 3. [This page](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/datagrip/postgresql.html#connect-to-postgresql-database) details how to connect DataGrip to PostgreSQL
